# Other Notes
Working under latest ESP-IDF v5.3.0 (not v5.3.3 or higher), compiled on Visual Studio Code. Multi-device support may not work on lower versions of the SDK.

**Developed and tested on the ESP32 DevKit rev 1 board, other variants may not work!**

WARNING: This project is for use in a plain ESP-32 module with BLE and BT Classic support and dual core processor. If you have another variant like C3, you'll have to adapt the code.

* ESP32 S3/C3 (BLE only boards): [Check](https://github.com/Hamberthm/esp32-bt2ps2/issues/3)
* USB-HID instead of PS/2: [Check](https://github.com/Hamberthm/esp32-bt2ps2/issues/4)
